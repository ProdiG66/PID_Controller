# PID Controller for Unity

<img src="/Documentation/0.jpg" width="260">

## Overview

This project provides a simple and versatile Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller implementation for Unity. PID controllers are widely used in control systems to maintain or achieve a desired setpoint by adjusting the system's output. This Unity-specific PID controller can be easily integrated into your Unity projects to achieve precise and stable control in various applications.

## Features

- **Easy Integration:** The PID controller is designed to be easily integrated into your Unity projects, allowing for seamless use in a variety of scenarios.
- **Customizable Parameters:** The controller comes with customizable PID parameters (Proportional, Integral, Derivative gains) to fine-tune the performance based on your specific requirements.
- **Versatility:** Suitable for a wide range of applications, such as robot control, camera stabilization, and other scenarios where precise and dynamic control is necessary.

## Requirements

- Unity installed (version 2021.3.9f1 or later).
